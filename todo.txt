Criar conta:


-passar verificacoes no admin eventos para pasta do bd



I would do it this way:

1) Upon completion of registration, flag account as inactive (pending confirmation), and create two strings of random characters.

2) Store both strings in the database and associate them with the user.

3) Email a link to the user that has a link back to a page on your site and contains both strings.

Ex: www.mysite.com/confirm.php?auth1=j0832r2&auth2=fji4j32ion

4) Have your page check that both codes match, and if so, flag the account as active.

Hope this helps.
